<h2>Abstract</h2>
<span class="markdown">
The Built Heritage Properties (BHP) taxonomy contains OWL properties to describe built heritage aspects of constructions, construction components, spatial zones, damages, etc.
The main taxonomy is structured using RDFS subsumption axioms, starting from either [contax:property_OP](https://w3id.org/con-tax#property_OP) or [contax:property_DP](https://w3id.org/con-tax#property_DP).

The BHP taxonomy was created by Mathias Bonduel (KU Leuven) during his PhD research (2017-2020) funded by the Research Foundation Flanders in the form of a Strategic Basic Research grant (grant agreement 1S65917N).
